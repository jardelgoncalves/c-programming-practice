 * Implement a function that receives two double precision floating-point values, `A` and `B`, which represent the grades of a student.
 * The function should then calculate the student's weighted average, where **grade A has a weight of 3.5** and **grade B has a weight of 7.5**.
 * The total weight is therefore 11. Assume that each grade will be between 0 and 10.0, with one decimal place.
 * The output (printf) should look like: AVERAGE = 6.43182
