 * Implement a function that calculates the area of a circle. The area is calculated using the formula `area = π * radius²`, where π is approximately 3.14159.
 * The function should take the radius as an argument and print the calculated area in the format A=area (e.g "A=12.5664"), where the area is rounded to four decimal places.
 * You must use printf to print the result in the following format: A=area, where the area is rounded to 4 decimal places.
