# Exercise: Difference Between Two Integers

![Level: Basic](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Basic-brightgreen)

In this exercise, you are tasked with implementing a function that calculates the difference between two integers. The difference is the result of subtracting the second integer from the first.

## Requirements:
- Implement a function that takes two integers as arguments.
- Calculate the difference between the two integers (i.e., subtract the second integer from the first).
- Return the result of the calculation.

You do not need to worry about reading input or handling edge cases; simply implement the logic to calculate the difference and return the value. The result should be returned, not printed.

## Instructions:
1. Open the file `basic_level/005_difference_between_two_integers/difference_between_two_integers.c` in your preferred code editor.
2. Remove the comments and placeholder code:
  - The code youâ€™ll find in the file is a placeholder, with comments indicating that the function is not yet implemented. You need to remove these comments and the unnecessary lines.
3. Implement the function:

4. Compile the file `basic_level/005_difference_between_two_integers/main.c`:
    After implementing the function, you need to compile the `main.c` file, which contains the test code that checks whether your function works correctly. Open a terminal and run the following command:
    ```bash
    gcc -o main_executable main.c
    ```
    This will compile the `main.c` file and generate an executable named `main_executable`.

5. Run the compiled file:
    After compiling, you can run the generated executable to test your implementation. Use the following command to execute the program:
    ```bash
    ./main_executable
    ```
    The program will run the test cases and output whether your implementation of the `difference_between_two_integers` function is correct.
